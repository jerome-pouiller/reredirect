reredirect - A tool to dynamically redirect outputs of a running program
========================================================================

reredirect is a utility for taking an existing running program and
attaching its outputs (standard output and error output) to files or
another process.

Using reredirect, you can log output of a already launched process, redirect
debug output of a background process to `/dev/null` or to a pager as if you 
launched it with `>` or `|`.

Installation
------------

With [clib](https://github.com/clibs/clib):

    $ clib install jerome-pouiller/reredirect

or from source:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jerome-pouiller/reredirect.git
    $ cd reredirect
    $ make
    $ make install

Usage
-----

Simple usage is:

    reredirect -m FILE PID

It will redirect outputs of PID to FILE. It is also possible to redirect standard
output and error output in different files:

    reredirect -o FILE1 -e FILE2 PID

`-m` option is just a shortcut to `-o FILE -e FILE`.

After launched, reredirect, give you command to restore state of PID.
It will looks like:

    reredirect -N -O 5 -E 3 5453

`-O` and `-E` act as `-o` and `-e` but with already opened file descriptors in
PID. They only used to restore previous state of PID.

Redirect to a command
---------------------

`reredirect` can redirect outputs to special files as `/dev/null`. It can also
redirect outputs to "named pipes". Using "named pipes", you can redirect output 
of your target to another command (as a normal pipe):

First create a named pipe:

    mkfifo /tmp/myfifo

Run `reredirect` to redirect your target to /tmp/myfifo:

    reredirect -m /tmp/myfifo PID

Launch a command on this named pipe:

    less < /tmp/myfifo
    tee my_log < /tmp/myfifo
    cat -n < /tmp/myfifo


Trick with Makefile
---------------------

Sometime, I work with complex projects and I want to log subparts of compilation
output in different files. I use this trick:

    target:
    	@FIFO=$$(mktemp -u); mkfifo $$FIFO; tee my_file.log < $$FIFO & ./redirect -m $$FIFO $$PPID > ./restore_$$PPID.cmd
    	@echo Call sub makefile here
    	@sh ./restore_$$PPID.cmd
    	@echo No more in log file

Portability
-----------

reredirect is Linux-only. It uses ptrace to attach to the target and control it at
the syscall level, so it is highly dependent on Linux's particular syscall API,
syscalls, and terminal ioctl()s. A port to Solaris or BSD may be technically
feasible, but would probably require significant re-architecting to abstract out
the platform-specific bits.

reredirect works on i386, x86_64, and ARM. Ports to other architectures should be
straightforward, and should in most cases be as simple as adding an arch/ARCH.h
file and adding a clause to the ifdef ladder in ptrace.c.

ptrace_scope on Ubuntu Maverick and up
--------------------------------------

`redirect` depends on the `ptrace` system call to attach to the remote program. On
Ubuntu Maverick and higher, this ability is disabled by default for security
reasons. You can enable it temporarily by doing

    # echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope

as root, or permanently by editing the file /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf, which
also contains more information about exactly what this setting accomplishes.

How does it work?
-----------------

Reredirect act as a debugger to take control of running process (it use ptrace 
syscall). Once it took control of runnign process, it use classical calls to 
`dup`, and `dup2` to change targets of file descriptors 1 and 2.

Basicly, to redirect to file, this pseudo code is executed:

    orig_fd = 1;
    save_fd = dup(1);
    new_fd = open(file, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, 0666);
    dup2(new_fd, orig_fd);
    close(new_fd);

and to restore state:

    ret = dup2(save_fd, orig_fd);
    close(save_fd);
